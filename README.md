# PCA-Mice-Protein-Expression-Analysis

This project analyzes mice protein expression data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key proteins that differentiate between various classes of mice under different experimental conditions.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To reduce the dimensionality of protein expression data and identify significant proteins.
- **Dataset**: [Mice Protein Expression Data](https://doi.org/10.24432/C50S3Z).
- **Methods**: Data cleaning, PCA, logistic regression for classification.

## Key Findings

- Reduced 77 protein expressions to 9 significant components using PCA.
- Identified key proteins using logistic regression with Lasso penalty.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCA-Mice-Protein-Expression-Analysis.git
