# Analysis of PCA Results

## Overview

This analysis focuses on the Mice Protein Expression dataset, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify significant protein expressions and understand class distinctions.

## Comments on PCA

### Observations

- **Overlap**: There is significant overlap between all classes at the center of the scatter plot, indicating shared protein expression profiles among the classes.
  
- **Spread**: The classes c-CS-m and c-CS-s are more spread out compared to other classes, suggesting greater variability within these groups.
  
- **Grouping**: Class t-CS-m forms a fairly distinct group toward the top right of the scatter plot, indicating unique protein expression patterns. Similarly, t-SC-s gathers around the middle along the gap between other classes.

- **Isolation**: Class c-SC-s has a fraction of its data separate from the main cluster, highlighting some unique characteristics within this class.

### Analysis

The scatter plot shows that while some separation among classes is apparent, there is still a large overlap forming a cluster. This suggests that while PCA helps in reducing dimensionality and highlighting some distinctions, further analysis is needed.

### Approach

Given the overlap in the PCA results, we applied regression techniques to identify outstanding protein expressions. By reducing the dataset to 9 principal components, we aim to determine which protein expressions are major contributors to class distinctions. This regression analysis helps to pinpoint the significant proteins that distinguish the different classes based on their expression profiles.

## Conclusion

The PCA and subsequent regression analysis provided insights into the protein expressions that play key roles in differentiating classes. Despite the overlaps, certain proteins stand out, suggesting their importance in understanding the underlying biological differences among the classes.
